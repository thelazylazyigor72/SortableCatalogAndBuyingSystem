Things i've covered this lil' project:
- User attributes | data-*, and their usage in js&css
- How to create dynamic catalog w/ btns dat filters this catalog (also here how thru iterators make a whole peaces of code, how to use reduce to get array of unique items from another array, data-*, concept when u work w/ elements on page right after they were created, concept of how some data cover in HTML and place on page)
- Also i've done by myself cart system which is absolutely in a right way sensetive to context of processes, comments actually will say and show this whole thing a lot better so watch it in app.js 
- Page is responsive, got a hamburger menu, few just flat modals... 
So dats pretty much it.
 
This lil project was my lesson dat i've done by myself and now it reminder of how to do proper dynamic catalog + shopping system as well,
so thats it, all comments are saying errything u need to understand if u forget what was done. 
I.S.
